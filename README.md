# Java-Programming

### Introduction to Java

Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language. Java is first released by Sun Microsystem in 1995. Java was created by a team lead by James Gosling. Java is a platform independent programming lanaguage. Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or can be distributed among servers and clients in a network.

### Java Features

    1. Simple   
    2. Secure  
    3. Portable    
    4. Distributed     
    5. Object Oriented     
    6. High Performance    
    7. Robust      
    8. Dynamic     
    9. Multithread  
    
### Java Internals

##### 1. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
      Java virtual machine is a machine that run the Java Bytecodes. JVM does not understand java source code .java file must compile to obtained .class file which contains         byte code.
      
      Java Code ---> Java Compiler ---> byte code ---> JVM
        .java                             .class         Windows, Linux, Mac OS  
     
##### 2. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
       It provides the libraries, JVM and other components to run applets and applications written in the java programming lanaguage.
                JRE = JVM + Set of Libraries + other additional files.
       JRE does not contain tools and utility such as compilers or debuggers for developing applets and application.
       
##### 3. Java Development Kit (JDK)
       JDK is a superset of the JRE and contains everything that in the JRE, plus tools such as the compilers and debuggers neccessary for developing applets and application.
       
       JDK = JRE + Development Tools

    ### Do While Loop 
    
    do {
         statement(s)
    } while (expression);
    
    1.  The difference between do-while and while is that do-while evaluates its expression at the bottom of the loop instead of the top.
    2.  The statements within the do block are always executed at least once.
